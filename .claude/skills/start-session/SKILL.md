# Start Session

Initialize a new coding session for MathMate.

## Instructions

1. Read the following files to understand current project state:
   - `TODO.md` - Development progress and next steps
   - `lib/docs.md` - Technical documentation
   - `prd.md` - Product requirements (if needed for context)

2. Provide a brief summary:
   - **Last completed phase** and what was done
   - **Current status** (tests passing, any blockers)
   - **Next priority** items from TODO.md

3. Ask what the user wants to work on this session

Do NOT start any implementation until the user confirms what to work on.
